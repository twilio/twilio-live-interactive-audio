# 1.1.0 (May 27, 2022)

- Use Swift Package Manager instead of CocoaPods to manage dependencies for the iOS app. Xcode will install dependencies automatically instead of having to run `pod install`.
- Add `npm run remove` command so that customers have an easy way to reset the deploy and start over if they run into issues. See the [readme](https://github.com/twilio/twilio-live-interactive-audio#deploy-the-app-to-twilio) for more info.
